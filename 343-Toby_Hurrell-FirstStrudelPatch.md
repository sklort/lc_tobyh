[My patch](https://strudel.cc/?6XEPHrz1pbRA)

For my patch, I tried to make a sort of dembow beat with lots of randomization.
I mostly used the | random segment picker and the ? random silence. I also experimented with putting triplets/different meters in.
To emphasize certain beats, and to create interlocking rhythms, I layered the same instrument over itself multiple times.
I then used the random silence to create differences in the strength of the beat hits, for instance with the bd and sd segments.
One of the problems I ran into was that I tried to make a new stack with an AlmostNever function to randomly play in different meters.
However, I didn't know how to implement multiple stacks, so I just embedded the other meters inside the main stack.
